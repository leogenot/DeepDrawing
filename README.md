# DeepDrawingGeneration
Deep Learning to make drawings

# Installation
## Setup the environment:

(using Tensorflow 1.5 and directML to make it work with AMD GPUs)
```bash
conda create --name NAMEOFYOURENVIRONMENT python=3.6 
```
```bash
conda activate NAMEOFYOURENVIRONMENT
```

You can either install pip dependencies by hand of by wtriting pip install -r requirements.txt in command line
```bash
pip install tensorflow-directml
```
```bash
pip install ipykernel
```
```bash

```
```bash
pip install imageio
```
```bash
pip install graphviz
```
```bash
pip install scipy
```
```bash
pip install pydot
```
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## and then run the notebook in your preferred app

# Google Collab
## Setup the environment:
